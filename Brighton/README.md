## Tips (for a dry day)
* This is a fast course. As you develop confidence on the circuit, you will find you don't need to brake at corners 3, 5, 8, or 9.
* With practice, you may be able to reduce use of the brake pedal to corners 1, 4, 7, and 10.
* The longest 'straight' is from corner 7 to corner 10. The earlier you start the straight, the faster you will be by the end. Corners 8 and 9 can be taken flat out.
* Keep momentum as high as possible. Sodi karts will bog down at low speeds.
* While the starting grid is on the straight leading to turn 1, the finish line is just after turn 2.
* Be careful into turn 6. There's a drainage grate in the chevrons on the inside of the turn that you really don't want to hit.
