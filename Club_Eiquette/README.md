# Club Etiquette

Motorsport is a dangerous activity and we do not want to see anyone injured during one of our events.  Accidents happen and it takes only a split second for things to go wrong.  Unlike SIM racing, it can really hurt if you crash!  To avoid this, every kart club member attending an event is expected to understand and adhere to the following:

* Take all circuit track briefings seriously.  Make sure you understand what you are being told.  Some circuits have slightly different rules and regulations so make sure you are clear on any variations.

* Racing is a non-contact sport.  If you gain an advantage through contact you should always aim to give the place back.

* Never place another person in danger by forcing them off the track or into a barrier. 

* Do not defend or attack over aggressively.  If you are relying on the other driver to take avoiding action or leave the track in order to complete your move, you have gone too far.

* Keep calm during the first lap.  You can't win the race on lap one, but you can lose it, and possibly compromise someone else's race and fun. Think before you make that 'do or die' maneuver in the first few corners.  The chance of 'do' is very slim.

* Respect each other, help each other get better, and compete fairly.  We are partners (and guests) first and racers second.
