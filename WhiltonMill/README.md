# Whilton Mill

![Aerial View](images/WhiltonMill-AerialView.jpg)

Located just northwest of Northampton, Whilton Mill is one of the club's favourites and thus the choice for the <del>Rainbow</del> Super Cup. All qualified drivers battle head to head for a winner-takes-all finale to the season. The circuit is also popular with owner-drivers and part of the Club-100 circuit, and you'll find no end of YouTube videos of racing at this location.

## Video

GoPros are allowed at Whilton. As a result you can indulge yourself in numerous trips around the circuit and even enjoy famous overtaking manoeuvres such as this popular [multi-million-views (it'll get there)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLOuIrwMlWw) example from Chris.

## Driving Tips

There's a super [video track driving guide here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aenDbbbgKio). There's also a [Club 100 guide for you to digest](https://club100.co.uk/circuit-guide/whilton-mill-bite-size-track-guide/).

A word of warning though!. The owners of Whilton Mill are VERY keen on keeping their lease karts in good condition and as a result are highly likely to penalise you if you stray over kerbs.

REPEAT: CROSS THE KERBS AT YOUR PERIL.

Adjust what you learn from video appropriately. Perhaps the only thing you're likely to get away will be the [runoff area after the hairpin](https://youtu.be/aenDbbbgKio?t=233) but check on the day during the briefing if you're not sure rather than take anything for granted.
